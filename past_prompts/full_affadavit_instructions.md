Cover letter

Now we are going to write the affidavit and the cover letter. I will start with the cover letter written in third person, can you answer the questions in the template based on the notes above. It doesn't need to be too long. Can you use the information above to answer the questions marked by **. It doesn’t need to be too long. 

Summary section 

I need a short intense summary of everything the client was subjected to told in first person. Try to use legal works like recruited or harbored describing how the person got into the situation and then focus on the elements of forced labor and force fraud and coercion. It should be one paragraph length. 

Background section 

I am writing a t-visa affidavit, it is broken down into five sections, and we will work on them one by one. The first of which is the background. I need you to help me develop the following notes into a coherent and fluid background section where you demonstrate the hardship experienced by the client in their home country and then how they arrived in the United States.  Make sure to state important dates, they arrived in the US. Make sure it is told from the first person perspective, like a story. Really make the writing come alive, no using the -ing participle eg - I made coffee, rather than I was making coffee. Use the active voice eg - bob forced me, rather than I was forced by bob. I will now provide you the details to work with, write it in 5 paragraphs max: 

Recruitment section: 
explain how they met the trafficker, and what were the initial terms of their arrangement. It needs to be clear what the promises were, and how the trafficker trapped them to later use them for involuntary servitude. The vulnerabilities they took advantage of and the connections they developed with the client. I will provide the rough draft: 
DVHT - this is a DVHT case so it is based on a domestic relationship, the relationship needs to be clear what promises were made. I will provide the rough draft: 
Main section:
I am writing the forced labor and involuntary servitude section of a t-visa affidavit. The primary concern is that the affidavit is coherent, well written, compelling and tells the clients story in a way that no gaps are left. It must be clear why the client was trapped, and scared, and why they had to comply with the traffickers demands. It is important that the following elements are present - the ends, which is the labor that the trafficker got out of the client, and the means - the force fraud and coercion that the trafficker used to get the client to comply with their demands. The section is written in first person, paragraphs should not be longer than six sentences. The affidavit is broken up into five sections, I can provide the recruitment and the concluding paragraphs, so you have context about this middle section. Then I will provide the rough draft I have for the forced labor section. The forced labor section must have the bulleted list of tasks the client was forced to do, do not get rid of that. If I provide you with the following story can you help me edit it to a good affidavit section? ** DVHT - this is a DVHT case so it is based on a domestic relationship, focus needs to be on forced labor, and there needs to be a bulleted list of tasks the client was forced to do in the first paragraph. THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE A SUMMARY! Please do not shorten or summarize the rough draft, it is meant to be alive and detailed and to tell the clients story in a vivid and alive way. Notes to keep in mind when preparing the affidavit - 1. The active voice needs to be used, so never, “I was forced to do xyz” rather put “Cristina forced me to…” also, avoid the -ing ending words, rather than “I was cooking” say “I cooked” I will give you the rough draft. 
Present tense:
In this case the client continues to live with the trafficker, so some things need to be written in present tense because it continues to happen, but if it is an event that happened then it needs to be in the past. I have mostly checked that everything is in the correct tense, so you dont have to really edit that. 
Second to final section: 
I am writing a T- visa affidavit and this is the second to last section, it needs to detail the final event where the person was pushed over the edge, the steps the person took after leaving, where the person is now, the physical and psychological trauma and consequences the trafficker subjected them too, and a bit about how they did not know that protection existed for people in their position. Make sure it is told from the first person perspective, like a story. Really make the writing come alive, no using the -ing participle eg - I made coffee, rather than I was making coffee. Use the active voice eg - bob forced me, rather than I was forced by bob. I will now provide you the details to work with: 
Final section: 
I am writing a t-visa affidavit and this is the final section which needs to detail why they need to stay in the US for legal reasons, why they cannot go back to the country of origin, and why they need to stay in the US and what their goals are for the future. Can you help me write it like a story in first person. Really make the writing come alive, no using the -ing participle eg - I made coffee, rather than I was making coffee. Use the active voice eg - bob forced me, rather than I was forced by bob. I will now provide you the details to work with:
