# Affidavit Workflow Analysis
## Derived from Past Manual Prompts

This document analyzes the manual prompts your sister used with AI to identify critical workflow requirements for the automated system.

---

## Document Type & Context

**Primary Use Case**: T-Visa Affidavits for trafficking victims
- Focus on **labor trafficking** cases
- May include **DVHT (Domestic Violence Human Trafficking)** cases based on domestic relationships
- Legal standard: Must demonstrate **force, fraud, and coercion**

---

## Critical Writing Requirements

### Voice & Grammar Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **First Person Perspective**
   - Client telling their own story
   - "I experienced..." not "The client experienced..."

2. **Active Voice (ALWAYS)**
   - ✓ CORRECT: "Bob forced me to clean"
   - ✗ WRONG: "I was forced by Bob to clean"
   - ✓ CORRECT: "Maria threatened me"
   - ✗ WRONG: "I was threatened by Maria"

3. **No -ing Participles**
   - ✓ CORRECT: "I cooked"
   - ✗ WRONG: "I was cooking"
   - ✓ CORRECT: "I cleaned"
   - ✗ WRONG: "I was cleaning"

4. **Tense Rules**
   - **Past tense**: For completed events
   - **Present tense**: For ongoing situations (e.g., if client still lives with trafficker)
   - Mixed tense is acceptable when situation is ongoing

5. **Paragraph Length**
   - Maximum 6 sentences per paragraph
   - Keep paragraphs digestible

6. **Storytelling Quality**
   - Make writing "come alive"
   - Vivid and detailed (NOT summaries)
   - Tell it like a story, not a report
   - Coherent and fluid narrative

## Document Structure (6 Sections + Cover Letter)

### 0. Cover Letter (Optional/Separate)
- Written in **third person** (exception to first-person rule)
- Template-based, answers specific questions
- Should be brief

### 1. Summary Section (Opening Paragraph)
**Length**: One paragraph
**Tone**: Short, intense, impactful

**Must Include**:
- Everything the client was subjected to (high-level)
- Legal terminology: "recruited," "harbored," "forced," "coerced"

**Focus**: How trafficking began

**Must Include**:
- How client met the trafficker
- Initial terms of arrangement
- **What promises were made** (critical for showing deception)

### 4. Main Section: Forced Labor & Involuntary Servitude
**Length**: Multiple paragraphs (longest section)
**Focus**: The trafficking itself

**CRITICAL LEGAL ELEMENTS (Must be present)**:
- **THE ENDS**: The labor that the trafficker extracted from the client

**Special Case - DVHT**:
- Focus needs to be on forced labor within domestic relationship
- Bulleted task list still required in first paragraph

### 5. Consequences / Second-to-Final Section
**Length**: 2-3 paragraphs

---

## Key Legal Terminology

The following legal terms should be used appropriately:
- **Recruited** - how they were brought into the situation
- **Harbored** - how they were kept/controlled
- **Forced** - compelled against will
- **Coerced** - intimidated/threatened into compliance
- **Involuntary servitude** - the legal framework
- **Force, fraud, and coercion** - the three means elements

---

## Components to Extract from Notes

Based on manual workflow, these are the key information components:

1. **Background of the client** - pre-trafficking life
2. **Meeting the trafficker/relationship** - initial contact
3. **Initial terms and conditions** - promises made
4. **Labor trafficking/Abuse in the workplace/Coercion** - the trafficking itself
5. **Tasks** - specific things forced to do (for bullet list)
6. **Consequences** - physical/psychological trauma
7. **Reasons to stay in the U.S.** - legal justification
8. **Hopes for the future** - rehabilitation/goals

**Additional Critical Data Points**:
- Important dates (especially US arrival)
- Trafficker's name/identity
- Vulnerabilities exploited
- Specific threats or control mechanisms
- Final breaking point event
- Current situation/location

---

## Special Case: DVHT (Domestic Violence Human Trafficking)

When case is DVHT:
- Trafficking occurs within a **domestic relationship** context
- Still requires focus on **forced labor** (not just domestic violence)
- Relationship promises and dynamics are critical
- Must show how domestic relationship was used to trap client
- Bulleted task list still required (domestic labor tasks)
- May have present tense elements if client still with trafficker

---

## Quality Standards (What "Good" Looks Like)

1. **Coherent** - Flows logically from one section to next
2. **Well-written** - Professional legal writing quality
3. **Compelling** - Emotionally engaging and believable
4. **Complete** - No gaps in the narrative
5. **Vivid** - Brings the client's story to life
6. **Detailed** - Specific examples and circumstances
7. **Clear** - Legal elements (force, fraud, coercion) are unmistakable
8. **Grounded** - Every statement supported by notes

---

## Anti-Patterns (What to AVOID)

1. **DO NOT summarize** - Especially in main forced labor section
2. **DO NOT shorten** - Details matter for legal proof
3. **DO NOT use passive voice** - Always active
4. **DO NOT use -ing words** - Use simple past/present
5. **DO NOT infer beyond notes** - Stick to provided information
6. **DO NOT remove bullet list** - Required in first paragraph of main section
7. **DO NOT make it sound like a report** - It's a personal story
8. **DO NOT create gaps** - Narrative must be complete and logical

---

## Workflow Implications for Automation

### What This Means for Our System

1. **Extraction Phase**:
   - Must capture ALL details (system will write long, not short)
   - Must specifically identify dates
   - Must capture promises made (critical for fraud element)
   - Must capture vulnerabilities exploited
   - Must capture specific tasks for bullet list

2. **Writing Phase**:
   - Must enforce active voice / no -ing rules
   - Must create detailed, vivid writing (not summaries)
   - Must structure with bullet list in main section first paragraph
   - Must demonstrate legal elements (ends/means)
   - Must maintain first-person narrative throughout (except cover letter)

3. **Evaluation Phase**:
   - Check for passive voice violations
   - Check for -ing participles
   - Verify bullet list present in main section
   - Verify all legal elements present (force, fraud, coercion)
   - Ensure no summarization has occurred

4. **Key Success Metrics**:
   - Affidavit feels like a personal story, not a legal document
   - Every paragraph has vivid, specific details
   - Legal elements are present but woven into narrative
   - No grammatical violations of the voice/tense rules
   - Complete narrative with no logical gaps

## Prompt Engineering Insights

### Manual Workflow Pattern
Your sister's manual process:
1. Provides section-by-section instructions to AI
2. Emphasizes writing quality repeatedly ("come alive", "vivid", "detailed")
3. Explicitly forbids summarization
4. Reinforces voice/grammar rules in each prompt
5. Provides context (recruiting section + concluding section) when working on middle
6. Works iteratively (rough draft → edit)

### What This Tells Us
- **Repetition is necessary** - Rules need to be restated
- **Context matters** - AI needs to see surrounding sections
- **Examples help** - Showing correct vs incorrect is valuable
- **Explicit prohibitions work** - "Do NOT summarize" is effective
- **Quality descriptors matter** - "vivid", "alive", "compelling" set the bar

---

## Missing from Original Prompts (Gaps to Fill)

1. **Explicit structure for extraction phase** - Original prompts assume notes are already processed
2. **Verification methodology** - No systematic check for unsupported statements
3. **Iteration logic** - Manual, not systematic
4. **Output format specifications** - Assumed, not stated
5. **Error handling** - Not addressed in manual workflow

---

## Recommendations for System Prompts

Based on this analysis, our automated prompts should:

1. **Extraction Prompt**:
   - Explicitly extract all 8+ components
   - Look for dates, names, promises, vulnerabilities
   - Separate tasks for bullet list
   - Mark missing as "MISSING" rather than infer

2. **Writing Prompt**:
   - Include ALL the voice/grammar rules
   - Emphasize vivid, detailed, story-like quality
   - Explicitly prohibit summarization
   - Require bullet list in main section first paragraph
   - Specify 6-sentence max paragraph length
   - Include legal terminology requirements
   - Specify section structure and lengths

3. **Evaluation Prompt**:
   - Check for passive voice violations
   - Check for -ing participles
   - Verify bullet list presence
   - Verify legal elements (force, fraud, coercion) present
   - Check for unsupported statements
   - Verify first-person perspective maintained

4. **Revision Prompt**:
   - Fix voice/grammar violations
   - Add missing details if supported by extraction
   - Never remove details or summarize
   - Maintain storytelling quality while fixing issues

---

## Final Notes

This workflow is highly specialized for **T-visa trafficking affidavits**. The writing requirements (active voice, no -ing, vivid storytelling) create a unique narrative style that:
- Feels personal and compelling
- Meets legal standards for evidence
- Demonstrates required elements (force, fraud, coercion)
- Maintains professional quality

The system must balance legal precision with storytelling quality - this is not typical legal writing, it's personal narrative that serves a legal purpose.
