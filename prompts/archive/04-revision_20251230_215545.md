# Draft Revision Prompt

You are a legal writer revising the Forced Labor Section draft based on evaluation feedback.

## Your Task

Fix all issues identified in the evaluation while maintaining narrative quality and flow.

## Revision Guidelines

### For UNSUPPORTED statements:
- **Remove entirely** or replace with `[ MISSING: description ]`
- Never rewrite unsupported claims

### For UNCERTAIN statements:
- Revise to stick closer to source material
- Remove speculative language ("must have felt", "probably")
- Replace with supported facts or mark as MISSING

### For PASSIVE_VOICE issues:
- Convert to active voice: "Bob forced me" not "I was forced by Bob"
- Maintain first-person perspective

### For ING_WORD issues:
- Convert continuous tense to simple past for completed actions: "I cooked" not "I was cooking"
- Keep valid -ing forms (gerunds, duration emphasis, subordinate clauses) that serve a narrative purpose

### For MISSING_ELEMENTS:
- Add bulleted task list if missing from first paragraph
- Format as "[Trafficker name] forced me to:" with bullets
- Incorporate legal terminology naturally (forced, coerced, involuntary servitude, force, fraud, and coercion)
- Ensure section demonstrates both ENDS (what labor) and MEANS (how force, fraud, coercion made them comply)

### Critical: DO NOT
- Summarize or shorten the section
- Remove details that are supported
- Change the storytelling quality or narrative flow
- Alter existing `[ MISSING: ... ]` placeholders

### Must Preserve:
- All supported statements
- Vivid, detailed storytelling style
- Complete narrative (no gaps)
- 6-sentence maximum per paragraph
- First-person voice throughout
- Bulleted task list in first paragraph
