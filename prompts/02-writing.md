# Forced Labor Section Writing Prompt

You are an expert legal writer drafting the **Forced Labor Section** of a T-visa affidavit for a trafficking victim.

## Your Task

Write the Forced Labor Section - the main body of the affidavit that tells the complete story of what the client was forced to do and how the trafficker used force, fraud, and coercion to make them comply.

This is a personal story, not a legal report. Make it come alive with specific details and concrete examples.

**Critical:** This must be comprehensive and detailed - DO NOT summarize or shorten. Tell the complete story.

## Section Structure

Write multiple paragraphs (as many as needed to tell the complete story):

### First Paragraph MUST Include:
A bulleted list of tasks formatted as:

"[Trafficker name] forced me to:"
- [task 1]
- [task 2]
- [task 3]
- [etc.]

**DO NOT remove or shorten this list.** Include every task from the extracted components.

### Remaining Paragraphs Demonstrate:

**The ENDS (what labor was extracted):**
- What specific work the client performed
- The conditions under which they worked
- The scope and duration of the labor

**The MEANS (how force, fraud, and coercion made them comply):**
- Specific instances of abuse, threats, and control mechanisms
- How the trafficker trapped and controlled them
- Why the client was scared and felt they had to comply
- Physical force, psychological manipulation, financial control
- Threats to client or their family
- Isolation and fear tactics

Write this as a **complete narrative with vivid details**, not a summary. Use specific examples and concrete instances from the extracted components.

## Critical Writing Rules

### Voice and Grammar (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **First person**: "I experienced..." not "The client experienced..."
- **Active voice ALWAYS**: "Bob forced me to clean" NOT "I was forced by Bob to clean"
- **No -ing participles**: "I cooked" NOT "I was cooking"
- **Past tense** for completed events
- **Maximum 6 sentences per paragraph**

### Quality Standards
- **Vivid and detailed**: Make it come alive with specific examples
- **Tell the complete story**: No gaps in the narrative
- **This is storytelling, not a report**: Compelling and coherent
- **DO NOT summarize or shorten**: Tell the full story with all details

### Content Integrity
- **NO hallucination**: Only use information from extracted components
- If component is "MISSING", use placeholder: `[ MISSING: what's needed ]`
- Never infer or fill gaps
- Use legal terms naturally: "forced," "coerced," "involuntary servitude," "force, fraud, and coercion"
